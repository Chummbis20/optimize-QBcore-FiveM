local cachedArray = Config.SomeArray
local arrayLength = #cachedArray
```

### **Player Value Management**:
```lua
-- Example: Periodic player value updates
CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        playerPed = PlayerPedId()
        playerId = PlayerId()
        Wait(5000) -- Update every 5 seconds
    end
end)
```

### **Intelligent Sleep Management**:
```lua
-- Example: Dynamic sleep based on state
local sleep = someCondition and 0 or 1000
Wait(sleep)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Critical Warning**: QB-SmallResources is heavily used by QBCore framework. Any modifications must be thoroughly tested to prevent framework-wide issues.

2. **Backup Requirement**: Always backup original files before applying optimizations.

3. **Testing Protocol**: Test each optimization individually in a development environment before production deployment.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor server performance metrics after each optimization round to ensure positive impact.

5. **Compatibility**: All optimizations maintain full compatibility with existing QBCore systems and third-party resources.
